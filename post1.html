            <p>Welcome to my brand-new blog! This is the first step in my web development journey. Building this simple site has been a great learning experience. I've learned about HTML tags, CSS properties, and the importance of a clear file structure.</p>

            <p>The process started with a blank page and a lot of questions. What's a `DOCTYPE`? What's the difference between `<header>` and `<h1>`? By breaking down the website into smaller components—the header, the main content, and the footer—the task became much more manageable.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned So Far</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**HTML Structure:** The basic skeleton of a web page using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>`.</li>
                <li>**CSS Styling:** How to use selectors (like `.post-card`, `#container`) and properties (like `font-family`, `display: flex`) to make the page look good.</li>
                <li>**Responsiveness:** Using `meta viewport` and `max-width` to ensure the site looks good on different devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm excited to continue this journey and share more of my discoveries. Stay tuned for the next post on CSS styling techniques!</p>
